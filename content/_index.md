## What is this?

As developers we often switch between various languages, and sometimes it's difficult to remember how to do the little things. 

> *How do I lower-case a string?*

> *What's the list append function called?* 

> *How do I iterate over the key/value pairs of a map?*

> *Speaking of which, what's the map initialization syntax again?*

Don't sweat it, that's what **[whatsthecodeforthat.com](https://whatsthecodeforthat.com)** is here for, with short snippets reminding you how to handle the small things in various languages.
