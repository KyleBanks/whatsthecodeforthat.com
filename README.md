As developers we often switch between various languages, and sometimes it's difficult to remember how to do the little things. 

> *How do I lower-case a string?*

> *What's the list append function called?* 

> *How do I iterate over the key/value pairs of a map?*

> *Speaking of which, what's the map initialization syntax again?*

Don't sweat it, that's what **[whatsthecodeforthat.com](https://whatsthecodeforthat.com)** is here for, with short snippets reminding you how to handle the small things in various languages. If you don't see a section, example or language that you need, submit a [pull request](https://github.com/KyleBanks/whatsthecodeforthat.com) to help out.

## Contributing

If there's a section, language, or snippet you think is missing or needs updating, please don't hesitate to help out. When making modifications, please follow these general guidelines:

### - Content Sections

If you're adding a new section or subsection to [/content](./content), please try to:

- order the content in order of sophistication; for example, arrays come after primitives, classes come after functions, etc.
- reorder surrounding folder numeric prefixes in lieu of a better system 
- try to avoid language-specific content and aim to focus on situations common to various languages; for example, `goroutines` are unique to the go language, so instead of a `goroutines` section it makes sense to have a `concurrency` section
- ensure an `_index.md` with `title` front-matter for each folder
- limit to depth of content to section and subsection, no more and no less

### - Languages

If you're adding a new language, please try to:

- focus on popular languages, rather than obscure or esoteric ones
- add the language to the list in [config.toml](./config.toml) in alphabetical order
- ensure the language is suitable to be included in most content sections

### - Snippets

If you're adding a language snippet to an existing content section, please try to:

- use the file naming convention of `<lower-case-name>.md`; for example `go.md` or `python.md`
- limit the code sample to using the standard library
- keep the code equivalent to other examples in the same content section, including variable names and values, use of print statements, etc.
- avoid over-optimization, instead strive for simplicity and the general use case
- the snippet file should contain one code block (marked by triple ticks), and any commentary should be done in langauge-specific comments

## Running the Site Locally

This project uses [hugo](https://gohugo.io/) to generate a static website from markdown, so you'll need to have [hugo installed](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/quick-start/#step-1-install-hugo) to run locally. After that, use the `make` target like so to have the site generated, auto-reloaded on changes, and your browser opened:

```
$ make local
```
